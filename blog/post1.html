                    <h2>E-commerce</h2>
                    <p class="time">July 3rd, 2023</p>
                    <p>E-commerce started due to the benefit of the invention of the <a href="https://blog.miva.com/the-history-of-ecommerce-how-did-it-all-begin#:~:text=The%20history%20of%20ecommerce%20started,the%20history%20of%20the%20internet.">Electronic Data Interchange</a> during the 1960s. Being able to transfer data and information via the internet allowed the possibility of making transactions online. The idea of <a href="https://www.nexcess.net/blog/history-ecommerce/">online shopping</a> was first introduced in the 80s in the United Kingdom by Michael Aldrich, who made transactions between business and business come true. Public consumers weren’t in the E-commerce market until the 1990s when the World Wide Web was developed by Tim Berners-Lee. It was a significant leap forward in the history of the Internet that gave the public general access to the Internet where people can purchase and sell products.</p>

                    <p>The invention of the internet brought a lot of possibilities in E-commerce. Numerous companies and businesses arose in the 90s trying to have a share of the pie. <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/d/dot-com-bubble-and-burst">The Dotcom bubble</a> formed as a result of low-interest rates and everyone’s interest in investing in new companies; however, the bubble burst in 2000 for several reasons: <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/d/dot-com-bubble-and-burst">high-interest rates, recession, and overinflation in the market</a>. The E-commerce market grew rapidly in the 90s, but many of the then-famous businesses declined and disappeared after the Dotcom bust, such as Pets.com and Boo.com. Amazon and eBay are still leading forces in the E-commerce market today.</p> 

                    <p>Online shopping has benefited humans for decades now, and it is undoubtedly providing more convenient lifestyles for humans as well as platforms for businesses to expand their market and audiences. I shop on the Internet regularly, and in fact a lot of the time online shopping is my first option. Especially during the pandemic, I benefited a lot from E-commerce because of how convenient it is.</p>
