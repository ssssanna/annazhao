                    <p>Vlado Pavlik’s article showcases some of the basic elements as well as features of HTML. It was interesting to learn that a more structured HTML web page will improve a site's SEO compared to a site without proper HTML elements. The article also discusses that semantic markup not only defines the layout of a page but also gives meaning to the content. Its ultimate purpose is to present information in a semantically structured way to the audience so that they can easily understand and access the information. For my article, I used semantic elements to structure the layout of the page and used CSS styling to present the content as an article on a web page instead of a straightforward term paper.</p>

                    <p>I divided my article’s HTML into header, nav, main, and footer to help better structure the content. My original article already has a header and a table of contents. Hence I included <i>header</i> and <i>nav</i> elements at the top of the page to introduce the title as well as the table of contents presented as lists. Moreover, the article contains five sections, so I added an <i>article</i> element with five <i>section</i> elements within to clearly define its main content. This not only provides a semantic way for me to understand but also organizes the information into a layout that is easy for the audience to access. Readers will also be able to access each individual section within the article by clicking on the links within the table of contents. For sub-headers, I applied <i>h2</i> to differentiate them from the main header and used <i>p</i> to define body paragraphs. I intended to group my content into different containers, and I filled the containers with corresponding information, which helped to define the hierarchy of my page.</p> 

                    <p>For my blog page, I experimented with different color schemes, buttons, and card styles when constructing the design comp. I want to present the content to the audience in a direct way, so my page mainly contains three parts: header, main, and footer, where the header introduces the audience to the blog page, the main showcases the three blog posts and footer contains my contact information. I’m going for a clean and professional theme for the design. I think the most challenging part of visual design is how to organize and align the information in a way that is best for the audience to read without much cognitive load.</p>
